### About

This file documents an exercise meant to test a UI developer candidate for a position on the CloudSense Sales Production Team. 

### The Task

The task is to replicate the following design using any combination\* of frontend technologies that the candidate may prefer, in the form of a functional mock-up, using the included data model.

![Design reference]()

The design reference includes a static header and a formatted list of Orders.

The header includes the CS logo, a search bar, and an account widget. The account widget should feature a dropdown menu (not featured; improvise).

The Orders list is composed of individual Order entries, each of which features a collapsed summary view, and an expanded content view. 

The collapsed view lists data relating to the order, a minimal milestone tracker, and a button link. The expanded view includes a full-size milestone-tracker, and a formatted table of related suborders. Each suborder entry features its data and a button link.
