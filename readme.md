### About

This file documents an exercise meant to test a UI developer candidate for a position on the CloudSense Sales Production Team. 

### The Task

The task is to create a functional mock-up of the following design using any combination\* of frontend technologies that you may prefer along with the included data model.

![Design reference](/assets/design_reference_preview.jpg)

The mock-up should replicate the visuals of the design reference as closely as possible, and feature any functionality that you may be able to infer from it. Any additional functionality is generally welcome, although we recommend not going too far outside of the scope of what's there.

Your choice of technologies / solutions will not factor into any evaluation of your work, and you are free to use anything you like, except jQuery\*. We recommend using whatever you're most comfortable with, as the quality of your solution will be under scrutiny.

#### Structure and Layout

The design reference includes a static header and a formatted list of Orders.

The header includes the CloudSense logo, a search bar, and an account widget. The account widget includes a dropdown menu with typical options (not featured).

The Orders list is composed of individual Order entries, each of which features a collapsed summary view, and an expanded content view. 

The collapsed view lists data relating to the order, a minimal milestone tracker, and a button link. The expanded view includes a full-size milestone-tracker, and a formatted table of related suborders. Each suborder entry features its data and a button link.

All of the date fields for the above objects can be accesses via the provided backend model.

### Installation and Usage

You should either create a local clone of the repo or fork it, and install the node dependancies. While we did include Jade as an example templating engine, feel free to use whatever solution you are most comfortable with (a templating engine, framework, or even just pure javascript).
